# Exercise 03

For this exercise, you will setup a simple Express server that will serve as an access point to the holy beemovie script.

You will implement the following routes:

- `GET /`: Will return the entire script.
- `GET /search/:word`: Will return all the lines that contain the word `word`.
- `GET /count/:word`: Will return the number of times the word `word` appears in the script.
- `GET /lines/:line`: Will return the line number `line` of the script.
- `GET /lines/:line1/:line2`: Will return the lines from `line1` to `line2` of the script.
- `GET /random`: Will return a random line of the script.

Every response should be in the text format, and the script should be read from the file `beemovie.txt`.
Each line of the script should be separated by a newline character.
